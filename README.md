Project: Olympics 2024 Medals Viewer

Description:
This project consists of two Python programs designed to process and explore Olympic medals data from the 2024 Paris Games.

1. **data_collector.py**:
   This script processes raw data collected from the [Olympics website](https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/medals) and structures it into a CSV file (`olympics2024.csv`) for further analysis. It extracts data about countries, sports, athletes, and the medals they won.

2. **olympics2024_medals_viewer.py**:
   This program allows users to interact with the data generated by `data_collector.py`. Users can:
   - View a ranking of countries based on the total number of medals.
   - See all sports with medalists for a specific country.
   - View athletes who won medals in a specific sport.
   - Optionally, save the results of any query to a CSV file.

Usage:
- To use the **data_collector.py**, simply run it, and it will generate `olympics2024.csv` based on the raw text file input.
- The **olympics2024_medals_viewer.py** provides a menu system for users to select different ways to explore the data.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- pandas library (install via `pip install pandas`)

Instructions:
1. Place the input text file with Olympic data in the same directory as `data_collector.py`.
2. Run `data_collector.py` to generate the CSV file.
3. Run `olympics2024_medals_viewer.py` to interact with the CSV file.
4. Optionally, save filtered data to CSV from within the viewer.
